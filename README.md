# headscale-config

My WIP config for [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale). I don't currently have DNS working when selecting an exit node. Also, mobile clients aren't very well supported for now, Android is doable, but iOS isn't, so I've put setting this up on hold for now.

# TODO

- [ ] Get DNS working with exit nodes.
- [ ] Get Android exit nodes working.
- [ ] Stick `derper` in the same container as a tailscaled instance to enable client verification so nobody else uses my derper.
